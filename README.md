  - know how to design a proper database for small and micro project
  - know how to connect to database and develop apis
  - know how to organize your code structure
  - use Node and npm to manage your packages
  - handle Vue3 CompositionAPI
  - handle uniAPIS 
  - be able to develop a complete APP
 

**FrontEnd：Vue3 + uni-app**

UI and demands are in the "FrontEnd" directory

**BankEnd：thinkJS**
