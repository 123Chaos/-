# family-hospital-app

> This project may take 80 ~ 100 hours

- This is a fullstack project for starters, it's based on my undergrad lab's government project. You can obtain lots of useful skills in enginering, it can include:
  - know how to design a proper database for small and micro project
  - know how to connect to database and develop apis
  - know how to organize your code structure
  - use Node and npm to manage your packages
  - be able to develop a complete APP

**FrontEnd：use YOUR favor**

UI are in the "FrontEnd" directory

**BankEnd：use YOUR favor**

design what you can imagine!

**databse: better be mysql**

table structure are in the "data.sql" file

**Demo**

I have written a primitive version of this project and hope you can get something from my code. My frontend part is developed by Vue3 and compiled by **HbuilderX**, so if you don't like using a third part compiler which is my wish too, you can use your own way to set up an app compile environment maybe. For the backend part, I use the thinkJS which is light and degisned for mini project, I like it.

-- Wish you enjoy this.
